/**
 * Squarespace comes with a number of built-in facilities for managing images
 * that are uploaded to our system. After uploading an image into a collection,
 * Squarespace automatically creates multiple copies of the image with different
 * sizes. Our ImageLoader will then help render images properly when they are
 * presented on a page, even on retina displays.
 *
 * ImageLoader can also be used to fit or fill an image inside a parent
 * container, where it automatically determines which image size to use
 * depending on the current dimensions of the container.
 *
 * WARNING:
 * Currently, ImageLoader is present on all Squarespace sites under the global
 * namespace ImageLoader, but this is an unsupported API and we recommend
 * accessing this functionality through squarespace-core.
